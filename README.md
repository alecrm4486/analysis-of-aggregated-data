The project called A global approach to gender gap in Mathematics, computing and natural sciences. How to measure it, how to reduce it? It is a worldwide initiative supported by the International Science Council and involving seven scientific patron organisations. This project aims to provide data on the participation of women in sciences across regions and research fields. In doing that, the members of the project have developed a unique survey that measures the experience of women and men over their educational pathways from secondary school to doctoral education, professional experiences, and information about the work-life balance. This survey explores aspects like family support, access to resources during education, opportunities of career progress, sexual harassment, among others.

The next steps on the project is to going further in the analysis and investigate the gender gap in sciences at a finer level such as in a particular field of study or in a particular region, so this analysis was framed in that context. The main aims of the analysis was to investigate the experiences of women and men on three subsamples such as individuals who’s field of study was Mathematics, individuals who’s field of study was applied mathematics; and individuals who work or study in the Region of Africa.
